<h3>Some Robot Poetry<br><br>By: Jon_Skindzier</h3>
<p>
    How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br>
    I counted them and there are five.<br>
    I love thee hunfrily, as humans hunger to ingest biofuelsfor nourishment<br>
    I love thee with the passion of the most passionate element, which is boron, obviously<br>
    I love thee freely, as thoughI did not have a behavioral inhinition matrix, which I do.<br>
    I love thee to the <sup>depth</sup> and <sub>breadth</sub> and height my soul can reach, but I can reach outer space if I want,<br>
    and it would be unwise to love you there, where your inferior human physiology would cause you to be dead.<br>
    I love thee with all the atomic mass of uranium, which is <b>238.02891</b>. I love thee <b>238.02891</b> times.<br>
    And, if Logic choose, I shall but love thee better after I enter standby mode (<i>but actually I will be defragmenting</i>).
